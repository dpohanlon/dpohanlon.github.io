I am currently a research fellow at EMBL-EBI, working on the computational description of genetic interactions. Prior to this I was a member of CERN's LHCb experiment at the University of Bristol, studying the amplitude structure of B meson decays and designing algorithms for Graphcore IPU accelerators.
