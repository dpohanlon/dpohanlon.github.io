I am currently a postdoc in the [PÃ©rez-Carrasco](https://www.perez-carrasco.com/) group at Imperial College London, where I work on spatiotemporal models of competition in development, using machine learning to link experiment and theory . Prior to this I was a research fellow at EMBL-EBI, working on the computational description of genetic interactions with [Evangelia Petsalaki](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/petsalaki/). Before moving into computational biology I was a member of CERN's [LHCb](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) experiment at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/research/particle/areas/flavour-physics/), studying the amplitude structure of B meson decays and designing algorithms for Graphcore IPU accelerators.
